# Scheduled task export — example commands
# Export from a reference machine, then SANITIZE the XML before placing in config\tasks\.
# Replace C:\Users\YourName\... with %USERPROFILE% or a documented variable (e.g. TA_ROOT).
# Do not commit XML that contains your username or real paths.

# Export a single task by name:
schtasks /Query /TN "TaskName" /FO LIST /V

# To export as XML (PowerShell):
# $task = Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName "TaskName"
# $task | Export-ScheduledTask -OutFile "config\tasks\TaskName.template.xml"
# Then open the file and replace user-specific paths with placeholders.

# After sanitization, place the .template.xml in config\tasks\ and run:
# .\scripts\03_tasks_import.ps1
